# Snowflake Guide Template
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 60

In this post, we will guide you through setting up open-source Kafka on a Mac system. We'll configure the Snowflake Kafka Connector to enable Snowpipe Streaming with schema evolution. This setup allows seamless data ingestion from Kafka topics into Snowflake managed Iceberg tables, ensuring real-time data flow and handling schema changes efficiently.


### Prerequisites
- Setup Kafka on MacOS
- Download snowflake-kafka-connector-2.1.0.jar from [Snowflake kafka Connector] https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.snowflake/snowflake-kafka-connector/3.1.0
- A Snowflake account login with a role that has the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role. 

### What You’ll Learn 
- How to setup Kafka locally
- How to configure snowflake kafka connector for snowpipe streaming
- How easily schema evolution can be setup for Iceberg tables using snowflake kafka connector


### What You’ll Need 
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account 
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Installed

### What You’ll Build 
- A streaming pipeline through kafka to snowflake iceberg table


## Creating a Step
Duration: 2

A single sfguide consists of multiple steps. These steps are defined in Markdown using Header 2 tag `##`. 

```markdown
## Step 1 Title
Duration: 3

All the content for the step goes here.

## Step 2 Title
Duration: 1

All the content for the step goes here.
```

To indicate how long each step will take, set the `Duration` under the step title (i.e. `##`) to an integer. The integers refer to minutes. If you set `Duration: 4` then a particular step will take 4 minutes to complete. 

The total sfguide completion time is calculated automatically for you and will be displayed on the landing page.

## Code Snippets, Info Boxes, and Tables
Duration: 2

Look at the [markdown source for this sfguide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguides/master/site/sfguides/sample.md) to see how to use markdown to generate code snippets, info boxes, and download buttons. 

### JavaScript
```javascript
{ 
  key1: "string", 
  key2: integer,
  key3: "string"
}
```

### Java
```java
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Info Boxes
